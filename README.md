# TravorOS - Developing and Simplifying

This is the first [Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_System "Operating System Definition") I created. It's written in two languages: C language and Assembly.

This project has been activated since [December 15, 2017](https://github.com/TravorLZH/TravorOS/blob/master/ChangeLog.md)

### Bootloader

This OS uses a bootloader that switches from 16-bit real mode to 32-bit protected mode. It loads kernel code into memory before it entered 32-bit protected mode.

### Kernel

It's written in C. It simply calls other C standard functions that I implemented myself in [lib](https://github.com/TravorLZH/TravorOS/tree/master/lib).

## Note

This introduction will be frequently updated.
